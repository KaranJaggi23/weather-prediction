# Weather Prediction App

## Overview

This is a Machine Learning-based Weather Prediction App built using Streamlit. It fetches real-time weather data, predicts whether it will rain, and forecasts future temperature, humidity, and pressure trends.

## Features

 - Real-time Weather Data: Fetches current weather conditions from OpenWeather API.
- Rain Prediction: Uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict if it will rain tomorrow.
- Temperature, Humidity & Pressure Forecast: Uses a Random Forest Regressor for short-term future predictions.
- Beautiful UI: Interactive, gradient-based UI with weather icons.
